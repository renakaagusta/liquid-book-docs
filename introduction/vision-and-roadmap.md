# ðŸ’¡ Vision & Roadmap

At Liquidbook, we want to build a truly permissionless trading ecosystem that puts power back in the hands of our users. Our platform leverages Arbitrum Stylus technology to create a decentralized trading environment where users have complete freedom to list tokens, provide oracle data, and engage in perpetual trading without traditional gatekeepers.

### 1. Permissionless Token Listing

The future of token trading shouldn't be controlled by centralized authorities or limited by traditional listing processes. We're transforming how tokens enter the market by creating a truly open system where any user can list their token instantly and without barriers. Our platform eliminates the need for lengthy approval processes while maintaining high standards through code-enforced criteria and community-driven validation. This democratization of token listing not only provides enhanced visibility for innovative projects but also creates a more dynamic and responsive market environment where true price discovery can flourish.

### 2. Permissionless Oracle System

Our revolutionary approach to price feeds and market data represents a fundamental shift in how decentralized exchanges operate. By enabling community members to become oracle providers, we're creating a more robust and decentralized price discovery mechanism. Providers are incentivized through a carefully designed economic system that rewards accuracy and consistency, while our multi-source validation framework ensures data integrity. This approach not only improves price accuracy but also creates a more resilient system that's resistant to manipulation and better suited to serve the diverse needs of our trading community.

### 3. Permissionless Perpetual DEX

The perpetual trading landscape is being transformed through our innovative approach to decentralized derivatives trading. Users gain the power to not only participate in but also create new perpetual markets, opening up unprecedented opportunities for sophisticated trading strategies. Our platform combines this freedom with professional-grade tools, advanced risk management systems, and efficient cross-margin trading capabilities. This creates an environment where both retail and institutional traders can engage in perpetual trading with confidence, knowing they have access to the same powerful tools available in traditional finance.
